1) copy turbine power curves from format provided by robert preus to a new csv. this should look similar to '/Users/mgleason/NREL_Projects/github/diffusion/sql/data_prep/2a_prep_wind_resource_data/2_create_powercurve_csvs/powercurve_update_2016_01_08.csv'
	- save new csv in same folder as example above
	- rename first column to windspeed_ms and all other columns to the turbine names that will be used
2) run 1_powercurves_to_separate_csvs.R
	- this will dump the power curves out to the windpy powercurves folder
	- review individual csvs and make sure they are right
3) manually update documentation.csv in windpy powercurves folder to reflect the new power curves
4) Commit and push changes from local windpy to github
5) Edit 1_dwind_gen_update.sh with new powercurve names and output folder location
6) Run windspeed2power on gispgdb
	- ssh onto gispgdb
	- update local windpy repo (git pull origin master)
	- scp 1_dwind_gen_update.sh to gispgdb
	- kick it off in screen
7) Load the data from hdf to postgres (both hourly and annual data)
	- archive old tables, if they will be overwritten
	- run:
		- 2_hdf_results_to_pg.py
		- 3_hdf_hourly_results_to_pg.py
8) QA/QC the results
	- check annual aep is not very different from previous results for same turbine class and model
	- compare annual aep across 3 performance improvements for each turbine class -- should see moderate improvements in the 10% and 25% ranges from "current tech"
	- check cf_avg is close to the cf_bin (depending on the turbine height and power curve, it will likely be lower -- could be higher for future big turbines )
	- sum cf timeseries and compare to aep values -- should be close
	- other checks???
